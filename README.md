# **Smartwatch Daily Activity Analysis – MATPMDA Portfolio**

This repository contains my **R Studio Project**, analysing daily activity data collected from my smartwatch between **1st and 21st August 2025**. The dataset records step counts along with contextual factors such as work location, day type and breakfast habits. The goal of this portfolio is to explore how lifestyle factors relate to physical activity and to practice key statistical methods.

The analysis includes **visualizations** (histograms, boxplots), **hypothesis tests** (Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test, Pearson’s chi-squared test), and **linear regression**. 

**Key findings** include a significant increase in daily steps on days when breakfast is consumed, no clear linear trend in steps over time and a surprising association between breakfast consumption and working from home. Breakfast type preferences, however, showed no statistically significant pattern over the study period.

All data is included in tab-separated format and the complete workflow with code and plots is provided in the **RMarkdown file** and compiled **PDF**.
